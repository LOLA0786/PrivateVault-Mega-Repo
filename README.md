# OAAS: Optimization-as-a-Service
### The Indestructible Universal Optimization Layer

OAAS is a high-frequency, neural-accelerated engine designed to eliminate "lag" in industrial and financial systems. Built on a **Nesterov-Kalman Hybrid Architecture**, it predicts the future state of complex systems with sub-5ms latency.

## 🚀 Performance
- **Success Rate:** 100% at high concurrency
- **Avg Latency:** 3.36ms (MacBook Air Benchmark)
- **Engine:** Neural Nesterov + Adaptive Kalman Filter

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Logic:** PyTorch, NumPy (Nesterov Accelerated Gradient)
- **Gateway:** FastAPI (Asynchronous I/O)
- **Scaling:** Redis-ready State Management

## 📈 Use Cases
- **Fintech:** Reducing trade slippage by predicting price momentum.
- **Logistics:** Anticipating supply chain "stock-outs" before they occur.
- **Energy:** Managing battery discharge cycles in real-time.
