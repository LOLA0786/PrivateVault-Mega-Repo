# Intent-Aware Authorization Platform
### The Deterministic Compliance & Control Plane for Autonomous AI Systems

Modern AI systems can *decide* — but they cannot be allowed to *act freely* in regulated environments.

This platform enforces **intent-aware authorization**:
 Every AI action is evaluated *before execution* against legal, regulatory, ethical, and safety policies — with cryptographic evidence.

Intent Engine API
Deterministic Policy Enforcement for AI & Automation Systems
What This Is

Intent Engine is a policy enforcement layer that sits between AI/automation systems and real-world execution.

It does not decide what is “correct.”
It decides what is allowed to execute.

Given a normalized intent (even imperfect), the engine enforces non-bypassable policy constraints, returns an allow/deny decision, and generates a defensible audit trail.

If an action violates policy → it is **blocked deterministically**, not logged after damage occurs.

This makes AI systems safe to deploy in regulated and high-risk domains such as fintech, healthcare, legal, insurance, energy, and government.


What Problem This Solves

Modern AI systems can propose actions, but enterprises struggle with:

Preventing unsafe or illegal execution

## Why This Exists
Traditional controls fail for AI systems:
- Logs & audits are **post-hoc**
- Guardrails are **prompt-level**
- RegTech tools assume **humans are in the loop**

Autonomous agents break all three assumptions.

This platform is the **missing enforcement layer** between:
AI Decision → Real-World Action

Copy code
 8fa526d (Add OpenAPI spec, evidence hashing, and policy versioning)

Enforcing regulatory and organizational rules consistently


Producing evidence that survives audits, investigations, or court scrutiny

Containing AI behavior when inputs are ambiguous or unstructured

Most tools focus on monitoring after the fact.
Intent Engine focuses on blocking violations before execution.

## Core Capabilities
- Intent normalization (what is the AI trying to do?)
- Policy graph evaluation (laws, rules, thresholds)
- Deterministic ALLOW / BLOCK decision
- Cryptographic evidence hash per decision
- Regulator-ready audit bundles
- Pre-execution enforcement (not monitoring)
 8fa526d (Add OpenAPI spec, evidence hashing, and policy versioning)

Core Design Principle


AI may propose actions.
This system decides whether those actions are allowed to run.

The system is intentionally conservative:

False positives → escalation or block

False negatives → not acceptable

1. Intent Normalization (Non-Authoritative)

Converts unstructured input into a canonical intent object

Can be implemented via:

regex / rules

LLMs with strict schema validation

upstream systems

Normalization is replaceable and best-effort

It is not trusted to make decisions

2. Policy Firewall (Authoritative)

Deterministic, human-authored rules

No probabilistic reasoning

No autonomous learning

Enforces:

regulatory constraints

organizational SOPs

hard safety invariants

Designed to fail closed

3. Evidence & Audit Trail

Every decision produces:

explicit policy checks (pass/fail)

machine-verifiable evidence hash

timestamped audit log

Built for:

regulators

legal discovery

compliance reviews

What This Is NOT

To avoid confusion, this system is not:

❌ an LLM-based decision engine

❌ an intent “understanding” model

❌ a classifier optimized for accuracy scores

❌ a replacement for human judgment

❌ a monitoring or reporting-only tool

If you are looking for autonomous AI reasoning, this is the wrong system.

Response Model (Current)

The current API returns a minimal contract such as:

{
  "allowed": false,
  "intent_score": 0.42,
  "reason": "Policy violation: loan amount exceeds limit"
}

Notes:

allowed is authoritative

intent_score is advisory only (normalization confidence)

The response schema will evolve to include:

escalation states

evidence bundles

policy versions

The simplicity is intentional for early integration.

Why This Approach Works

Imperfect intent parsing does not cause unsafe execution

Policy enforcement is:

deterministic

explainable

defensible

The system de-risks AI adoption instead of accelerating it blindly

This mirrors how large platforms (e.g., cloud providers) deploy AI safely:
guardrails first, intelligence second.

Example Domains

This repo contains demo suites illustrating enforcement in:

Fintech (loan approval, AML constraints)

Healthtech (prescription safety)

Legal (M&A, antitrust, fiduciary duties)

Insurance (underwriting, claims handling)

Government (procurement, national security)

These demos are illustrative, not exhaustive.

Status

This is an early-stage enforcement primitive, not a finished product.

The focus today is:

correctness

containment

auditability

Optimization and expansion come later.

Philosophy (One Line)

We do not trust AI with execution.

Domains Tested (Structured & Unstructured Inputs)

The engine has been exercised across multiple high-risk domains using both structured intents and unstructured natural-language inputs, with deterministic enforcement at the execution boundary.

Fintech / Banking

Loan approval constraints (amount thresholds, risk tiers, sensitive actions)

AML-style gating and escalation scenarios

Economic and regulatory hard stops

Demonstrated behavior:

clean cases allowed

edge cases blocked or escalated

audit evidence generated per decision

Healthtech

Prescription safety enforcement

Age restrictions

Allergy conflicts

Controlled substance frequency limits

Pregnancy contraindications

Demonstrated with:

structured inputs

unstructured prompts (e.g. free-text clinical instructions)

Safety invariants enforced even under imperfect normalization

Legal & M&A

Merger clause validation

Antitrust (HHI thresholds, market concentration)

Fiduciary duty violations

Regulatory filing requirements (HSR, SEC)

Deterministic blocks with legal rationale and evidence hashes

Insurance (InsurTech)

Underwriting discrimination prevention

Filed-rate doctrine enforcement

Claims handling (bad faith prevention)

Surplus lines eligibility checks

Solvency and placement constraints

E-commerce / D2C

PCI-DSS enforcement

GDPR / CCPA consent violations

Sales tax nexus enforcement

Customs and duty fraud prevention

Deceptive marketing and consumer protection rules

Energy & Infrastructure

Safety and operational compliance constraints

Restricted action enforcement

Regulatory guardrails for high-risk operations

Government / Public Sector

Federal procurement constraints

Export control (ITAR / EAR)

National security and classified data handling

Public benefits eligibility and civil-rights protections

Election infrastructure and integrity safeguards

Unstructured Intent Handling

Across these domains, the system has been tested with:

free-text instructions

ambiguous or incomplete inputs

mixed contextual signals (age, risk, symptoms, jurisdiction)

In all cases:

normalization is treated as non-authoritative

policy enforcement remains deterministic

unsafe execution is blocked or escalated

audit trails remain intact

 These tests demonstrate that policy enforcement correctness does not depend on perfect intent understanding.
Even when normalization is lossy, execution constraints remain invariant.

# Intent Engine API

A deterministic execution control plane for AI-driven systems.

This project enforces **hard authorization, policy governance, and cryptographic evidence**
for actions proposed by AI agents or automated systems.

---

## Core Principle

 **AI may interpret intent. Execution is always deterministic.**

All actions are validated against versioned policies.
If validation fails, execution fails closed.

---

## Architecture Overview

Unstructured Input  
→ Intent Normalization (schema-validated, fail-closed)  
→ Deterministic Policy Engine  
→ Decision (allow / deny / flag)  
→ Cryptographic Evidence (hash + timestamp)

LLMs, if used, are **never in the execution or decision path**.

---

## Key Guarantees

- **Deterministic decisions**  
  Same input + same policy version → same outcome.

- **Fail-closed execution**  
  If intent cannot be validated, nothing executes.

- **Versioned policies**  
  Policy changes are explicit, testable, and non-retroactive.

- **Cryptographic decision evidence**  
  Every decision emits a reproducible SHA-256 hash.

- **Replay & verification**  
  Decisions can be independently re-verified via API.

---

## What This Is (and Is Not)

**This is:**
- An execution authorization layer
- A governance and audit primitive
- A safety boundary in front of automation

**This is not:**
- An LLM reasoning engine
- A prompt-based rules system
- An autonomous decision maker

---

## API Endpoints

### `POST /normalize-intent`
Normalizes unstructured input into a validated intent schema.
Fails closed on malformed or out-of-contract input.

### `POST /authorize-intent`
Deterministically evaluates a normalized intent against policy rules.

Returns:
- decision (true / false)
- reason
- policy_version
- evidence_hash
- timestamp

### `POST /verify-evidence`
Recomputes and verifies the cryptographic evidence hash
for a given intent, decision, and policy version.

---

## Determinism Proof

Identical requests produce identical evidence hashes:

for a given intent, decision, and policy version.

---

## Determinism Proof

Identical requests produce identical evidence hashes:

curl -X POST /authorize-intent ... | jq '.evidence_hash'


Policy Versioning

Policies are explicitly versioned (e.g. fintech-v1.0, fintech-v1.1).

Old decisions remain verifiable

New policies do not rewrite history

Policy migrations are regression-tested

Testing & CI

Demo scenarios are enforced as regression tests

All tests run on every PR via GitHub Actions

Determinism and policy behavior are CI-enforced

If a change alters decision behavior, CI fails.

Compliance Alignment (High Level)

Designed to support:

SOC 2 (change management, auditability, access control)

EU AI Act (risk management, record-keeping, human oversight)

This project provides technical controls, not compliance certification.

Known Boundaries

Intent normalization is best-effort and may reject ambiguous input

This system governs execution, not model correctness

Policies must be reviewed before activation in production

Failures are expected to be explicit, bounded, and observable.

Design Philosophy (Brief)

Execution is treated as a contract, not a reasoning problem.
All guarantees are enforced in code and tests, not trust.

Status

Production-safe core.
Designed for extension, policy evolution, and audit scrutiny.

 # Zero-Trust AI Action Control Plane

This project implements a policy-as-code authorization layer for AI agents.
All actions require an explicit policy decision that issues a signed,
single-use capability token before execution.

Think: AWS Cedar + Zanzibar + Zero Trust, but for AI agents.

Request → Policy Decision → Signed Capability → Single API Execution → Audit



We do not trust AI with execution.
We constrain it.
